# TekonOneThree-Controller

Control software for the TEKTŌN ONE THREE machine.

TEKTŌN is an on-going collaboration between Mike Faulkner and Paul Mumford. A series of virtual machines are driven parametrically to make light patterns in space.

TEKTŌN ONE THREE's mechanism is two horizontal bars of light points that animate up and down. At time of writing, this mechanism is modelled and animated in Touch Designer by Paul Mumford, realised on-screen in an audio-visual recording Paul made, and realised in physical space... with this, by me, as the 'brain' of a machine with 2m run up and down, and light bars that cantilever out 1.5m each. It's serious!

For some reason, I didn't use Git in the blur of initial development, so this is me reviewing just what I did after the fact and setting myself up for future incarnations. As such, the commit messages aren't the sane, granular steps they should be, and unfortunately git diff seems to crap itself on the python code so following the changes is harder than it should be.
